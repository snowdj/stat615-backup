Ergodic Time Series
========================================================

A stationary time series {yt} is ergodic if sample moments converge in
probability to population moments; 


## Stationary ergodic process
From Wikipedia,

In probability theory, a **stationary ergodic process** is a stochastic process which exhibits both stationarity and ergodicity. 

In essence this implies that the random process will **not change** its statistical properties with time and that its statistical properties (such as the theoretical mean and variance of the process) can be **deduced** from a **single, sufficiently long sample (realization)** of the process.

### time invariant
**Stationarity** is the property of a random process which guarantees that its statistical properties, such as the mean value, its moments and variance, will not change over time. A stationary process is one whose probability distribution is the same at all times. For more information see stationary process.

Several sub-types of stationarity are defined: first-order, second-order, nth-order, wide-sense and strict-sense. 


### time average
An **ergodic process** is one which conforms to the ergodic theorem. The theorem allows the **time average** of a conforming process to equal the **ensemble average**. In practice this means that statistical sampling can be performed at **one instant** across a group of identical processes or sampled over time on a single process with no change in the measured result. 

## Ergodic process


In econometrics, a stochastic process is said to be ergodic if its statistical properties (such as its mean and variance) can be deduced from a **single, sufficiently long sample** (realization) of the process. 


The reasoning behind this is that any sample from the process must represent the average statistical properties of the entire process, so that regardless what sample you choose, it represents the whole process, and not just that section of the process. A process that changes erratically at an inconsistent rate is not said to be ergodic,
