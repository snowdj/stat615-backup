## Stationary

1. mean is constant
2. covariance is related to time lag not the time point

For example:

white noise:

$$
\gamma_{t,s}=\left\{
\begin{array}{l l}
1 & (t=s) \\\\
0 & (t \neq s)
\end{array}
\right.
$$

Random walk:
$$gamma_{t,s}=t\sigma^2$$
depends on t so is nto stational. first order differentiation is.
