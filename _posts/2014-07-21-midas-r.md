## MIDAS regression R 
{% highlight r linenos=table%} 
install.packages("midasr")
library(midasr)
# or
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("midasr","mpiktas")
{% endhighlight %}


The midasr R package provides econometric methods for working with mixed frequency data. The package provides tools for estimating time series MIDAS regression, where response and explanatory variables are of different frequency, e.g. quarterly vs monthly. The fitted regression model can be tested for adequacy and then used for forecasting.

## Regional Analysis and Aggregation
- From a forecasting point of view, the pooling of disaggregated forecasts should help reduce the variance of the forecast errors, because the potential heterogeneity can be better captured.

- improvements in forecast accuracy

- the use of pooled region-specific forecasts improves upon the forecasting performance of countrywide GDP
