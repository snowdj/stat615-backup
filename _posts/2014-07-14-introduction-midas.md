The Econometric Analysis of Data Aggregation / Mixed Frequency Data
=====
        
        
## Definition

**Mi(xed) Da(ta) S(ampling) regression (henceforth MIDAS regression) construct regressions combining data with different sampling frequencies**

## Motivation
- A dilemma faced by forecasters is that data are not all sampled at the same frequency.

## Example
**Regression combining monthly and quarterly data.**
Such as exploiting high frequency financial data to predict low frequency macro data. 
- Models of stock market volatility
 - low frequency variable: quadratic variation
 - high frequency data: past market information
- Macroeconomic data
 - sampled monthly: price series and monetary aggregates
 - sampled quarterly or annually: real activity series like GDP
- News impact on the stock market
 - low frequency event: macro and corporate news
 - high frequency: individual stock returns
